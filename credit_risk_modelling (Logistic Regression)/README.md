<h3> Credit Risk Modelling in R </h3> 
Credit risk modelling is an important activity for financial institutions to help reduce 
the risk that a debtor will default on a personal/commercial loan. One of the most
widely used models in the credit scoring context is logistic regression, which I will
use in this project to explore and examine a sample credit data set. The code used in
my analysis can be found <a href="https://github.com/mendelchan/credit_risk_modelling-/blob/master/credit_risk_modelling.R"> here </a>.
